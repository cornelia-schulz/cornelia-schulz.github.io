                <p>Reflection is a mental process. It is contemplation or a long consideration.  
                  Thoughts or opinions that come to you while you are reflecting are called reflections. 
                  Unlike a reflection in a mirror, it in as interpretation of what is going on between learning and thinking.

                  <p>Habits are rituals and behaviors that we perform automatically, 
                    allowing us to carry out essential activities such as brushing our teeth, etc.
                    Our unconscious habits free up resources for our brains to carry out other more 
                    complex tasks like solving problems or deciding what to make for dinner.</p>
