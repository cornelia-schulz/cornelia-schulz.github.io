          <h1>Problem solving</h1>
          <p>
            Last week I was practicing to write some code and the goal was to ask the audience for a number and to create a chess board
            pattern that was as high and wide as the number they gave me. I knew I had to create a pattern that repeated
            itself, so in code I'd use something called a loop which does the same thing x amount of times.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I wrote one loop that would create the pattern of my row. Then I wrote a second loop to produce the row numerous times.
            But as you know a chess board has white and black fields and they are alternated. For some reason my rows would
            not alternate. The just looked stripy like a lavender field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most browsers nowadays have something called developer tools which are really handy if you want to know what is going on
            with your code. In Google Chrome you simply, press F12 or you can even just right-click anywhere in the browser
            window and select "Inspect". Then click on Console. In your code it is quite easy to add a few lines to just
            print or show every step you are doing, so eventually I found where I went wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole process took me quite a while and I actually had to take a walk and come back to the code with a clear head. But
            stepping through the code bit by bit, seeing what each instruction I wrote for the computer actually did, really
            helped me understand the situation and to eventually solve it.
          </p>
          <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
          <p>Here are some techniques for troubleshooting or approaching a new piece of code. Some of them I use more 
            frequently than others.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode: this is very handy, I first note down, what needs to be done in a new piece of code.
              Each step sits on a different line and is commented out. 
              I haven't used it very often yet but for bigger projects, it will help clarify what needs doing.
            </li>
            <li>Trying something: trying out things is a great concept if I face a new situation and don't quite know yet how to approach it.
              It's a good way to approach something new and unknown.
            </li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method: Me and my ducky do not speak the same language, I have tried to explain problems to my ducky,
              just so I could walk myself through the situation but I have never found my silent companion very useful.
            </li>
            <li>Reading error messages: this can be pretty tough as error messages can be cryptic sometimes. I'm hoping this will get easier at some point.</li>
            <li>Console.logging: this seems to be my go to method. When I get stuck or if I try to find out how something works, I will log it
              to the console and most of the times, it will help me resolve issues.
            </li>
            <li>Googling: Google is my best friend when it comes to solving code problems. Especially at this early stage of learning to code, chances
              are that somebody else ran into similar issues as myself. It is crucial to ask Google the right questions, which can be more
              complicated than it sounds.
            </li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help: not something I'm overly great at yet. I prefer asking Google dumb questions and only if I can't find my answers there, will I ask peers.
            </li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help: Similar to the above, Google is my first bet before I will ask anyone else.</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection: I like to reflect back at things after they are finished. Only this way can I find out what I could
               have done better.
