                    <h1>Design to web</h1>
                    <h3>What are responsive websites?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Responsive websites are websites that are easily readable from any device. On a responsive site the content including images
                        and tables, etc will simply adjust its size to the screen you are using to read the site. So no matter
                        if you are reading the site on your mobile, your tablet or if you are looking at it on a desktop,
                        you don't have to awkwardly scroll around and read tiny writing on a small mobile screen or massively
                        huge writing on your desktop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is quite important because you want to be able to find information fast and read content comfortably on any device, no
                        matter where you are at the moment.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is mobile first design?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mobile first design is exactly as it sounds: you start building your content for the smallest screen first and then scale
                        up to bigger screens, so eventually you cover the layout for all screen sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind this is to design the hardest layout for the tiniest screen first, so you have all essential features first.
                        From there you can take the idea and add new features on to make a site look good on larger screens
                        too. This should help you keep your design pretty consistent and build a proper brand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cons of this approach is that you start off with tiniest screen and probably start with a really simple design which
                        may not be very inspiring.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are frameworks?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Frameworks are libraries with reusable code to design websites and applications. They give you a base to build on while still
                        allowing you to be flexible with your layout and design.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Examples of front-end frameworks are:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bootstrap</li>
                        <li>Foundation</li>
                        <li>Stylus</li>
                        <li>Semantic UI</li>
                        <li>UI Kit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Pros of using a framwork</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Save time! With frameworks you can quickly and easily prototype designs</li>
                        <li>Utilise responsive design to allow your website to adapt to various screen sizes</li>
                        <li>Add consistency to design and code between projects and developers</li>
                        <li>Ensure cross-browser compatibility</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cons of using a framework</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using frameworks you will never understand the basics and won't get the satisfaction from creating
                            something from scratch</li>
                        <li>Frameworks are often large and it is likely that you only need a fraction of what they come with</li>
                        <li>You never know how long a particular framework is supported, so you don't know how future-proof they
                            are
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What are wireframes?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wireframes are simple black and white visual guides that are used to outline size and placement of elements on a website
                        to accomplish a particular purpose. They are the foundation on which you will start building. Below
                        are some examples wireframes:
                    </p>
                    <div class="row wireframe-images">
                        <div class="six columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Wireframe for the desktop index page">
                        </div>
                        <div class="six columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Wireframe for the mobile index page">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row wireframe-images">
                        <div class="six columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="Wireframe for the desktop blog page">
                        </div>
                        <div class="six columns">
                            <img src="../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="Wireframe for the mobile blog page">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The part on these wireframes that was most difficult to implement was the navigation panel.
                        It took me a while to get it exactly where I wanted it to be.
