          <h1>Motivation</h1>
          <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
          <p>
              In chapter six of his book "Search inside yourself" Chade-Meng Tan says there are three types of happiness: 
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pleasure: which makes you always chase the next high</li>
                <li>Passion: which is also known as flow, where you do something you love and time is flying by</li>
                <li>Higher purpose: which is about being a part of something bigger than yourself</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Pleasure is relatively short lived where as higher purpose is something that will leave you truly happy for a long time.
                In life we seem to be chasing our pleasures (like the next like on Instagram or Facebook...) when we really should pursue something that's truly meaningful.
              </p>
              <p>
                To achieve flow, you should align your work with your values and higher purpose. Once you can do that, it will mean that
                   </p>
                   <ul>
                     <li>The work is deeply meaningful to you</li>
                     <li>It easily generates a state of flow in you</li>
                   </ul>  
                   <p>Flow is a state of focused attention, which makes work enjoyable and time really fly by doing something we love.</p>

        <h3>Discovering values and higher purpose</h3>
        <p>
          Discovering values and higher purpose is an exercise that you can do by yourself at home or with another person.
          All you have to do is either discuss or journal your thoughts about these two prompts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are your core values?</li>
          <li>What do you stand for?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Values are things that you believe are important in the way yu live and work. They guide our behaviour and provide us with a personal code of conduct.
          <br/>
          For me personally some of my core values are health, respect and tolerance.
          <br/>
          I'd like to think I stand for curiosity and freedom.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>There are three elements that make up motivation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Autonomy: The urge to be the director of our own lives</li>
          <li>Mastery: The desire to get better and better at something that really matters to us</li>
          <li>Purpose: The wish to do what we do for something bigger than just ourselves</li>
        </ol>
       

        <h3>Resilience meditation exercise</h3>
        <p>
            To achieve what we want in life, it is good to build up resilience, so we don't give up at the first hurdle that life throws at us. There are meditation 
            techniques to build up resilience. In chapter six one such technique is being described.
          </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Direct your attention to your breath to start with</li>
                    <li>Think about a big failure in your life. What does it do to how you feel, how does your body feel when you think of this event? Can you shake these feelings off as feelings that will pass soon?</li>
                    <li>Think about a successful event in your life? What does it make you feel? Can you shake these feelings off as just passing feelings?</li>
                    <li>Direct your attention back to your breath</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Through resilience we will be able to overcome any obstacles along the way and find our path in life.
                  </p>
        <p>
          This meditation exercise is certainly a pretty tough one. I suppose like most people I don't particularly like to look back on my failures even though
           I know it is good to analyse what went wrong and how not to let it happen again. It's amazing how just thinking of them, the whole body can cringe whereas whereas thinking of 
           a positive experience will make the body feel great.
