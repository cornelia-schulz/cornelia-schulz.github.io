            <h3> What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>
                In web design, a grid is a structure made up of a series of intersecting straight (vertical,horizontal) guide lines used
                to structure content. Look at any website on the internet you will most likely be able to draw a grid around
                the content. These grids help you to be structured and to orginise your content.

            <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
            <p>Responsive webpages are all about being able to use your website from any device. So it doesn't matter if you
                are browsing from your phone, a tablet or your super duper 40 inch 4k monitor, the website will display the
                content you can easily browse it.
            </p>
            <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p>Semantic structure is all about writing clear code. And this means clear for the computer and clear for any other
                developer that might work with you. For example you could just wrap any html content into divs with different
                class names but it might be a lot clearer if you use h1 (or h2/h3/etc) for headers and p - tags for paragraphs.
                There are a lot of different tags which make it a lot easier for the browser to interpret your code. You
                can find a list and some explanations

            </p>
            <h3>Frameworks</h3>
            <p>There are a lot of frameworks for Frontend development which will help you to get up and running very quickly.
                Twitter Bootstrap is one of those. They have very extensive documentation on
                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/"
                    target="_blank">
                    their website</a>. In the framework they have a lot of pre-defined css for you to use, so you can quickly
                organise your content on your newly built website. Other frameworks are
