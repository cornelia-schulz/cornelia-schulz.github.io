      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <h3>What learnings did you take from chapter 1 of "Search Inside yourself"?</h3>
      <p>
        What is emotional intelligence? The book "Search inside yourself" describes it as the 
        being able to keep an eye on your own and others emotions in order to guide your thinking and your actions.
        <br />
        Emotional intelligence can be broken into five topics:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Self-awareness - know your own internal states</li>
        <li>Self-regulation - manage your own internal states</li>
        <li>Motivation - emotional tendencies that guide you towards your goal</li>
        <li>Empathy - be aware of other people's feelings, needs and concerns</li>
        <li>Social skills - be able to get desirable responses from others</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first two points are classed as intrapersonal intelligence as you are managing yourself, whereas the latter two are classed
        as interpersonal because you interact with others.
        <br/>
        You can learn emotional competencies by practise and they are an awesome thing to master as they will lead to:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Great work performance</li>
          <li>Great leadership</li>
          <li>Forming the path to happiness!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          According to the book happiness is an unavoidable side effect of practising emotional intelligence. You will also be 
          able to improve your resilience, optimism and kindness by optimising yourself and being mindful.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
          What are the two minutes of mindfulness? It's simply two minutes where you sit comfortably, close your eyes if you wish
          and simply be. You can concentrate on your breathing or simply be aware of how you are.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried out the two minutes of mindfulness for the first time a couple of days ago. It's an enjoyable experience
            to just simply breathe and be for a couple of minutes. It feels good to just let the mind wander and get a chance
            to switch off.
