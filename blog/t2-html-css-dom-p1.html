            <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical
                friend?</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine we are building a house. We use HTML to build the foundation and the general structure of the house. Your basic HTML
                will look like a blueprint of your house, you can see all rooms in the blueprint.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next comes CSS, we use it to design the look and feel of each individual room, it lets us have pink and purple walls with
                round or triangular corners.
            </p>
            <P>
                DOM stands for Document Object Model. You could picture it like a tree-layout of all the HTML you have written. So if you
                look at this page in the Chrome dev tools (right-click right here and select Inspect in Chrome), all HTML
                is contained in the HTML tags. They are the trunk of our tree. The tree then branches into a head and a body
                and each of those branches have even more smaller branches within them.
                <br /> If we stick to our building a house analogy, you could look at the DOM as a description on how to access
                your house and each element within that house.
            </P>
            <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
            <p>
                When you first look at a layout for a new website that you are tasked to build, it is easiest to break it down into individual
                boxes.
                <br /> On this very page for instance you can see various boxes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The blue box at the top that contains the name of the site</li>
                <li>The navigation bar</li>
                <li>The area with all the content you are currently reading</li>
                <li>And the footer at the very bottom of the page</li>
            </ol>
            Breaking things down into boxes, helps you set up the basic structure of your new website.

            <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
            <p>
                You will hear the term box model a lot when you work with CSS. Each HTML element is its own little box and each one of those
                boxes consists of the actual content (e.g. an image or simply some text), some padding, a border and a margin.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/boxmodel.PNG" alt="The CSS box model" />
            <p>
                In this box model it is important to note that the content and the padding all added up make up the size of an element. So
                if you have an image that is 100 pixels wide and you add some padding of 10 pixels on either side, the actual
                size of the image is 120 pixels. Use margins to add space between HTML elements.
                <br /> Right-click anywhere on this page and select Inspect to open up Developer Tools in Google Chrome. If you
                look to the area that contains all your styles and event listeners, you will see a tab called computed. Click
                on it to have a look at how individual items on this page are laid out.
