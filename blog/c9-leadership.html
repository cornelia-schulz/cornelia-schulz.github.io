                    <h1>Leadership</h1>
                    <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
                    <p>Over time I have met quite a few team leads who all had different leadership styles. In the more recent past
                         I have come across a number of very caring or compassionate team leads and it was a lot more easy to 
                         connect to them because you'd know they expect so much from you but would listen to various concerns within the team.
                         They'd not quite be your friend outside work but as close to one as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's much easier to work with a leader that has your trust and your respect.</p>
                    <h3>Multiplying goodness meditation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Breathe in goodness, multiply it by ten in your heart and breathe out more goodness. Feel the goodness of others around you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried the multiplying goodness meditation and must admit it did not do much for me. My mind kept wandering off wanting to follow the 
                        bright white light. I will give it another try though.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tonglen meditation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you are a mountain and you see the world from an elevated point of view. Then imagine sitting opposite
                         yourself, breathe in the pain of whatever has been troubling you lately. Turn it to goodness in your heart and 
                         breathe out the goodness. Then move on to other people. Breathe in their pain and turn it into goodness in your heart.
                         Breathe out goodness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I really like the idea of this meditation. I have tried it only once so far and it definitely needs
                        a lot more practice than that.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
                    <p>
                        SCARF stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. 
                        You can influence people most effectively when you help them achieve what they want
                        in a way that also helps you and simultaneously serves greater good.
                        By understanding the social brain, 
                        you can better understand how your actions can increase the SCARF factors for yourself and others. 
                        Once you master that you can find ways to help people in ways that also align with your own interests 
                        and create win-win situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have worked mostly on my own in Phase 0 but I think some of the things we learned in these early
                        sprints will definitely help with self confidence because we are building a solid foundation to work from.

                    </p>
                    <p>Understanding the social brain will be an invaluable skill to have when working closely with others,
                        especially because bootcamp is a fairly short time to cram a lot of knowledge and projects into. 
                        By knowing how to best work with all kinds of personalities this should hopefully be smooth sailing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h3>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                    <p>The way to make a friend is to be one.</p>
