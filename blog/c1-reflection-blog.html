    <h1>Reflections</h1>
    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
    <p>
      Having worked in various software development environments in the last few years, I am quite excited to learn more about how to collaborate, work as part of a team.

    </p>
    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>
      My impression is that this will be the hardest nine weeks ever but that they will be incredibly valuable for my future and I really want to make the most of the time at EDA.
    </p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm hoping to meet a lot of other enthusiastic people and to have fun emersing ourselves into the coding exercises and learning tons of new stuff.
    </p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>
      Having been to one of EDA's open days, this is exactly what my expectations were.
    </p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, I am excited about it but like Shereef in the Fireside chat, I'm more on the introverted side and it definitly makes me a little nervous.
