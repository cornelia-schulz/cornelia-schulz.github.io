      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>
        Having worked in various software development environments in the last few years, I am quite excited to learn more about
        how to collaborate, work as part of a team.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>
        My impression is that this will be the hardest nine weeks ever but that they will be incredibly valuable for my future and
        I really want to make the most of the time at EDA.
      </p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm hoping to meet a lot of other enthusiastic people and to have fun emersing ourselves into the coding exercises and learning
        tons of new stuff.
      </p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>
        Having been to one of EDA's open days, this is exactly what my expectations were.
      </p>
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, I am excited about it but like Shereef in the Fireside chat, I'm more on the introverted side and it definitly makes
        me a little nervous.
