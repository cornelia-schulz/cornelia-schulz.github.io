      <h2>Time and habits</h2>
      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p>
        During yesterday's and today's sessions I tried putting myself in a very positive and bright environment as well as removing
        most distractions like email or Facebook. I also tried having a break every 50-60 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>
        I found it amazing how my brain just stayed with the topic I was reading and learning about for a good few hours.
      </p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      <p>
        It was simply great having no disruptions for a while.
      </p>
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with??</h3>
      <p>
        I think I might give meditations a try to achieve better focus rather than getting distracted all the time.
