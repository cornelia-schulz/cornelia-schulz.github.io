    <h1>Time and habits</h1>
    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
    <p>
      During yesterday's and today's sessions I tried putting myself in a very positive and bright environment as well as removing most distractions like email or Facebook.
      I also tried having a break every 50-60 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
    <p>
      I found it amazing how my brain just stayed with the topic I was reading and learning about for a good few hours.
    </p>
    <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
    <p>
      It was simply great having no disruptions for a while.
    </p>
    <h2>Which will you experiment further with??</h2>
    <p>
      I think I might give meditations a try to achieve better focus rather than getting distracted all the time.
